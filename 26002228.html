<h3>Protect Your Personal Information</h3> 
</header>
<ul>Avoid sharing sensitive data like your home address, phone number, full birthdate, or financial details.</ul>
<ul>Think twice before posting photos that reveal personal locations or identificaton numbers.</ul>
<ul>Regularly review and update your privacy settings to control who can see your content and personal data.</ul>

<h3>Be Mindful of What You Post</h3>
</header>
<ul>Once something is online, it can be copied, shared, or misused-even if you delete it.</ul>
<ul>Avoid posting content that could harm your reputation or someone else's.</ul>
<ul>Consider how your words and images might be interpreted by different audiences.</ul>

<h3>Use Strong and Unique Passwords</h3>
</header>
<ul>Use complex passwords with a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols.</ul>
<ul>Avoid using the same password across multiple platforms.</ul>
<ul>Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) wherever possibles.</ul>

<dt>
<b>What is Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</b>
<dd>
Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) is a security process that requires two different forms of verification to access an account. After entering your password, you must confirm your identity using a second method—such as a code sent to your phone, an authentication app, or a fingerprint scan. This extra step helps protect your account even if your password is stolen.
