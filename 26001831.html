<p>Stay safe by learning how to protect your digital footprint</p>
<h3>Online privacy matters. Why?</h3>

<p>We are living in an advanced digital culture where nearly everything we do - shopping, banking, communicating - happens online.
This leads to more and more of our personal information being kept in places that are prone to thefts, and misuse</p>
<p>Personal information like our names, card numbers, emails, birthdates, etc. are often saved on websites, apps, and cloud services as a form of covienience.
While that does help, it also provides entry for cyber threats to enter and harm you in ways you least expect.</p>
With new forms of malware and cyberattacks on the rise, understanding the importance of safegaurding your personal information and strengthening your digital security
is essential to protect your online identity.
<p>By taking simple steps, you can greatly reduce the chances of your information falling into the wrong hands—and take back control of your digital life.</p>

<h3>1)Use strong passwords</h3>

<p>A strong password is essential to maintain strong security online</p>
<p>A strong password should contain:</p>
<ul>
<li>At least 12-15 characters mix with uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. The longer the password the more intricate it is making it harder to crack.</li>
<li>Avoid using personal information like birthdays, name, favourite food etc.- easy to guess</li>
<li>Avoid common sequences like "1234", "5555", and "password"</li>
</ul>
<p>Example of a good password:</p>
<ul>
<li>"cwhi!-987J-xyDp9@" - Contains upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>2)Enable 2 Factor Authentication (2FA)</h3>

</header>
<p>2FA acts as a second verification layer after your password, like a 4 or 5 digit code sent to your phone via your phone number or email.
<ul>
<li>Even if someone manage to obtain your password, the 2FA prevents them from fully logging in</li>
</ul>
<p>Example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Banking apps, gmail, and social media platforms will prompt for one-time code via an app or text message that only you will have access to</li>
</ul>
<p>This greatly improves account security because attackers will need your phone on top of your password to gain entry</p>
<br>
<h3>3)Be wary of what you share online</h3>

loading="lazy">
</header>
<p>Sharing too much personal information, especially publicly, greatly enhances the chance of attackers guessing your password, answer security questions and execute a plan to scam you</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sharing family member names and birthdates online may hint some of your security information and make them easy to guess</li>
</uL>
<p>Change your privacy settings so only trusted people like family members and friends can see your information</P>
<br>
<h3>4)Terminate unused accounts and data</h3>

width="250" height="200"
loading="lazy">
</header>
<p>Delete or remove old accounts, downloads, documents, browser add-ons, apps or any other data that is no longer in use - they can be tracked and reused by hackers which could lead to leaked data and information</p>
<p>Cancel data broker services (apps and sites that collect and sometimes sell personal information)</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cancelling inactive accounts like social media accounts and old shopping forum and sites reduces the risk of future data breaches.</li>
</ul>
<p>This reduces your "Digital footprint", reducing the likelihood of certain unfortunate events from happening like identity theft and exposure to being hacked</p>
<br>
<h3>5)Update software and devices regularly</h3>

width="230" height="200"
loading="lazy">
</header>
<p>Install updates for your operating devices, platforms, apps, websites, games, and anitvirus protection frequently - ensures everything remains new and secure</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Activate automatic updates if and when possible</li>
<li>Check weekly or monthly for updates on devices like routers, phones, laptops, and apps, which don't always auto-update</li>
<li>Don't disregard update notifications</li>
</ul>
<p>This strengthens online security as updates often fix security flaws that hackers tend to exploit</p>
<br>
<h3>6)Watch out for phishing scams</h3>

</header>
<p>Phishing scams mimic trusted entities that manipulate you into handing out personal information and credentials. Common types include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vishing(Voice phishing): Fake calls that impersonate banks, companies, family members, and friends often creating tension and pressure</li>
<li>Smishing(SMS phishing): Texts with suspicious links persuading you to act on it</li>
<li>Quishing(QR code phishing): QR codes in the form of coupons, vouchers, parking tickets, and flyers directing you to malicious sites</li>
</ul>
<p>Example:</p>

<table border="1">
<tr>
<th>Vishing</th>
<th>Smishing</th>
<th>Quishing</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>A scam call disguise as a bank, demanding immediate payment to avoid account termination</td>
<td>A phishing SMS containing a link to a harmless survey, urging you to do it in exchange for exclusive rewards</td>
<td>A quishing QR code in the form of fake vouchers, encrypted with a virus or malware</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Pro tip:</p>
<ul>
<li>Always pay close attention to the links to examine the actual URL, verify who the sender is and think carefully before reacting to urgent messages</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>7)Use a Virtual Private Network(VPN)</h3>

width="255" height="200"
loading="lazy">
</header>
<p>A VPN encrypts your internet traffic and re-routes it through a more secure server, hiding your real IP-address and online activities from hackers - making you a ghost to them.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are willing to, use a trusted and paid VPN like NordVPN, ExpressVPN, and ProtonVPN. (Free ones may sell your data)</li>
<li>Avoid logging in to personal accounts without a VPN when using public networks</li>
</ul>
<p>Without a VPN, your data on public wifi (in hotels, cafes, and airports) are prone to interceptions, a VPN prevents that by scrambbling your online traffic making it harder to decipher</p>
<br>
<h3>8)Refrain from clicking on suspicious ads or pop-ups</h3>

width="200" height="200"
loading="lazy">
</header>
<p>Flashy and intriguing ads, especially those offering a handsome amount of money, free household products, miracle health products, all which seems to good to be to be true, are often laced with viruses. Avoid them at all cost</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Install ad blockers like uBlock Origin, AdBlock Plus, and AdGaurd on your browser and other devices to block sketchy ads</li>
<li>If a site shows multiple pop-ups or fake "close" buttons, just close the entire tab</li>
<li><b>NEVER</b> download software from unverified sources - always go to the official website</li>
</ul>
<p>Many pop-up ads are designed to install malware on your device and redirect you to phishing websites that steal your data. If an ad seems way to good to be true, it most likely is. Don't click on it as most of these ads are a bunch of nuisances and red-flags.</p>
