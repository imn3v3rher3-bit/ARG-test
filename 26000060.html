<h1>🔐 Cybersecurity and Protecting Devices from Cyber Threats</h1>

<div class="section box">
  <h2>What is Cybersecurity?</h2>
  <p><b>Cybersecurity</b> is the practice of defending <i>computers, networks, mobile devices, and personal information</i> from digital threats. These threats can come in the form of hackers, viruses, or even fake websites trying to steal your data. In today’s digital world, almost everything — from school assignments to bank accounts — is connected to the internet. This makes cybersecurity more important than ever.</p>
  <p><strong>Example:</strong> <u>Imagine someone tries to break into your Instagram account by guessing your password.</u> Cybersecurity helps block that person, alerts you of suspicious activity, and can prevent your account from being stolen.</p>
</div>

<div class="section box">
  <h2>Common Cyber Threats</h2>
  <p>There are many types of cyber threats, and they can affect anyone — students, businesses, schools, and even governments. Understanding them helps us stay safe online.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Phishing:</strong> This is when you receive a fake email or message that looks real, asking you to click a link or share personal details like your password. These messages often trick people into giving away sensitive information.</li>
    <li><strong>Viruses & Malware:</strong> These are harmful programs that can infect your device, slow it down, delete files, or even spy on you. They usually come from suspicious downloads or fake websites.</li>
    <li><strong>Ransomware:</strong> A serious type of malware that locks your files and demands payment (a ransom) to unlock them. Even hospitals and schools have been targeted by this.</li>
    <li><strong>Data Breaches:</strong> When hackers break into databases and steal large amounts of information like names, emails, or credit card numbers. This can lead to identity theft or fraud.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Example:</strong> In 2021, a large US fuel company called Colonial Pipeline was attacked by ransomware. The hackers shut down fuel supplies and demanded millions of dollars. This affected gas stations and caused panic buying across the country. It shows how powerful cyber threats can be.</p>
</div>

<div class="section box">
  <h2>How to Protect Your Devices</h2>
  <p>Cybersecurity doesn’t need to be complicated. With just a few smart habits, you can keep your phone, laptop, and accounts safe from online threats.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Use strong passwords:</strong> Avoid easy passwords like "123456" or "qwerty." Instead, use a mix of capital and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Example: <code>G3n3r@t3D!pW</code></li>
    <li><strong>Keep your software updated:</strong> Always install updates for apps, browsers, and operating systems. These updates fix bugs and close security holes that hackers could use.</li>
    <li><strong>Install antivirus or anti-malware software:</strong> These programs scan your device for viruses and remove harmful files. They act like digital bodyguards.</li>
    <li><strong>Think before you click:</strong> If you get a message that seems suspicious or too good to be true (like “You’ve won a new iPhone!”), don’t click the link. Always double-check the source.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Example:</strong> A student received an email saying they had to "log in to their school portal urgently." The email looked real, but the website was fake. Because the student had antivirus software and double-checked with the school, they avoided being tricked and protected their login info.</p>
</div>

<div class="section box">
  <h2>Real-Life Impact of Cybersecurity</h2>
  <p>Cybersecurity affects every part of our daily lives, even if we don’t always notice it. Every time you use the internet, there are security systems working in the background to keep your data safe.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>In Schools:</strong> Cybersecurity keeps student data (like grades and attendance) protected from being accessed or changed by others.</li>
    <li><strong>In Hospitals:</strong> Patient health records are private and must be kept secure to avoid leaks or misuse of medical data.</li>
    <li><strong>In Online Stores:</strong> When you buy something from a website, cybersecurity protects your payment information so others can't steal your credit card number.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Example:</strong> In 2022, a school district in the U.S. had to cancel classes for a week after a ransomware attack locked their entire computer system. This shows how cyber threats can affect education, money, and people’s daily routines.</p>
</div>

<div class="section box">
  <h2>Fun Fact</h2>
  <p>Did you know? The first ever computer virus was created in 1986 by two brothers in Pakistan. They made it just to see if it would work — not to harm anyone! Today, there are over <b>1 billion types of malware</b> in the world.</p>
